Thom Jordan is an improvisational musician and software engineer specializing in the development of event-driven reactive components for interactive music practice. 

He's currently working toward the first public beta release of "Reactive Controls", a visual signal-based environment for hosting and running user-defined interactive performance setups. Some of its more novel features include: recombinant pattern generation, content-aware selection, automapping, tempo-sync with Ableton Link, and now real time generation and control of motion graphics defined by the user in an 'ISF' script [1].

In 2008, Thom returned to academia after more than a decade as a professional musician, majoring in Cognitive Science at SUNY Oswego, with minors in Cognitive Musicology and Computational Linguistics. Then in 2010 he transferred to SUNY Albany, graduating summa cum laude with a B.S. in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in 2012. Accepted into Georgia Tech's graduate Music Technology program, he started there as an M.S. candidate and graduate research assistant in the Fall of 2012.

After three semesters at GT in Atlanta, he returned to Upstate NY and began applying aspects of his personalized musical thought process in establishing an expanding set of music-generating performance-related use-cases in Objective-C, soon thereafter writing more and more code exclusively in Swift.

In June 2016, a long-imagined expansion of studio gear was underway with the arrival of a Kyma sound design environment. Along with its use as a highenviroment and transducer of raw, unbridled creative impulses, energy, and ideas,to test new expressions of musical theories and related setups during performance both live and virtual, with an ear towards establishing the more salient and successful ones as new features and use-cases worth developing as new candidates for inclusion into our expanding set of soft components, tools and processes.

Thom is in the process of relocating to Tucson, AZ for setting up 'Rationum', a small development shop and software brand with an associate who specializes in systems theory and design. We're also developing a unique style of live electronic music performance along with a new species of music bot emerging along the Ethereum blockchain.
