Thom Jordan is an improvisational musician and software engineer specializing in the development of event-driven reactive components for interactive music practice. 
He's currently working toward the first public beta release of "Reactive Controls", a visual signal-based environment for hosting and running user-defined interactive performance setups. Some of its more novel features include: recombinant pattern generation, content-aware selection, automapping, tempo-sync with Ableton Link, and now real time generation and control of motion graphics defined by the user in an 'ISF' script [1].


In 2008, Thom returned to academia after more than a decade as a professional musician, majoring in Cognitive Science at SUNY Oswego, with minors in Cognitive Musicology and Computational Linguistics. Then in 2010 he transferred to SUNY Albany, graduating summa cum laude with a B.S. in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in 2012. Accepted into Georgia Tech's graduate Music Technology program, he started there as an M.S. candidate and graduate research assistant in the Fall of 2012.

After three semesters at GT in Atlanta, he made a tough decision to leave the program, motivated by the necessity of limiting future debt as well as a personal need to reestablish a more spotaneous creative headspace. 
He went back to Upstate NY and began applying aspects of his personalized musical thought process in establishing an expanding set of music-generating performance-related use-cases in Objective-C, soon thereafter writing more and more code exclusively in Swift.

Thom began using the Kyma language in the summer of 2016 upon accidentally receiving a stray Pacarana system in the mail. He later realized that his subconsious self must have placed the order in a dream, knowing there'd be no way he'd want to return it after playing with it for few hours. The goal is to test new expressions of musical theories and related setups during performance both live and virtual, with an ear and eye towards establishing the more salient and successful ones as new features and use- cases worth developing and adding to the ever-expanding set of soft components, tools and processes.

Thom is in the process of relocating to Tucson, AZ, for setting up a development shop and associated software brand called 'Rationum', along with another music-creator colleague who specializes in systems theory and design. We look forward to re-refining our live performance and presentation skills, now with an ear toward emerging as a new species of underground music accessible via the Ethereum blockchain.



[1] Established by VIDVOX, makers of VDMX, 'ISF' (Interactive Shader Format) is an open-source file format and protocol used for generating low-level GLSL Fragment Shader code. Within an .isf script, a user might define some values then call some functions in the API, each expressed as valid JSON code in a text file with the extension changed to '.isf'.
